The simple implementation of the grid topology verification kernel can be found
in the grid_debug.cu
In principle you can start a new project using nsight and compile it within the
RAD, but just for fun and to get a bit more hands on please copy it to your work
area and compile by hand:

nvcc grid_debug.cu -o grid_debug

and run it:

./grid_debug

Next, please implement the timing we discussed during the lecture and rerun the program
noting the time performance. Since the kernel does not do anything it will be super fast.
Try to make things more interesting and create a vector on the host and move it to the
device and back - you may do some processing as well, but this not the point of this exercise.
Now measure how long does it take to move data to and from the device. Next, use the nvidia
dedicated too for profiling nvprof and compare the time measurements. To use the profiler
just execute:

nvprof ./grid_debug

Play with the size of the data you transfer to the device. Make plots with the results
as a part of the first lab report.
